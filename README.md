# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis

Natural language processing (NLP) tasks include sentiment analysis. All social media platforms should track the sentiments of persons participating in a topic. When it comes to politics, we usually see negative comments on Twitter. As a result, each platform should continue to study attitudes in order to identify the kind of people that promote hatred and hostility on their platform.


For the challenge of Twitter sentiment analysis, I created a dataset by web scrapping the tweets from Twitter using snscrape ( It is a scraper for social networking services (SNS). It scrapes things like user profiles, hashtags, or searches and returns the discovered items, e.g. the relevant posts). Our objective here is to determine how many tweets are unfavourable and good so that we may draw a conclusion. So, in this project, I'll walk you through a Twitter sentiment analysis work in Python.
